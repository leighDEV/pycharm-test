# # Basic Part 1
#
# # 1 - Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format.
# print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,"
#       "\n\tHow I wonder what you are! "
#       "\n\t\tUp above the world so high, "
#       "\n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky. "
#       "\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star, "
#       "\n\tHow I wonder what you are")
#
# # 2 - Write a Python program to get the Python version you are using.
# import datetime
# import sys
# print("Python version")
# print(sys.version)
# print("Version info.")
# print(sys.version_info)
#
# # 3 - Write a Python program to display the current date and time.
# import datetime
# print(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
#
# # 4 - Accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.

# 5 - Accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.
first_name = input("Enter first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter last name: ")
print("Hello", last_name, ",", first_name)

# 6 - Accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
